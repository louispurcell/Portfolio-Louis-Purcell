                <p><strong>Project Title:</strong> Edit Maker – Real-Time Audio-Responsive Video Editor<br>
                <strong>Unit:</strong> Interactive and Digital Arts<br>
                <strong>Software:</strong> Max (Cycling ‘74)</p>
                <p>This project was developed as part of an assessment in Interactive and Digital Arts, a unit focused on learning and applying new digital tools within a short timeframe. The task challenged me to independently explore an unfamiliar software—Max—and transform that learning into an original audio-visual work.</p>
                <p>I created Edit Maker, a real-time video editing tool that dynamically responds to music and sound. The system allows users to import any video clips and control transitions and effects through audio-driven triggers. By using Max's visual programming environment, I designed the interface to respond to both keyboard inputs and audio beats, syncing visual changes like color shifts, scaling, and lighting effects directly with music cues.</p>
                <p>The interface includes mapped keys to toggle visual effects, and beat detection logic that automates clip transitions and edits based on drum hits or tempo changes. Users can also reset layout positions or switch tracks mid-performance, showcasing the tool’s adaptability and real-time responsiveness.</p>
                <p>This project taught me how to prototype and execute interactive digital tools with a focus on media synchronization, offering insight into creative coding and the intersection of sound and image in live audiovisual performance.</p>

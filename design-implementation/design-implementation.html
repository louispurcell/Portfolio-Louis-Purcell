<h3>Design Concept</h3>
<p><strong>Project Title:</strong> BatWing Website Design<br>
<strong>Unit:</strong> Principles of Web Design<br>
<strong>Software:</strong> Adobe XD</p>
<p>This project was developed as part of the Principles of Web Design unit, where the goal was to conceptualize and prototype a multi-page website using Adobe XD. The focus of the task was to apply core web design principles such as layout structure, design patterns, typography, and colour theory in both low-fidelity and mid-fidelity mockups.</p>
<p>The website is a fictional promotional page for the “BatWing,” a Gotham-inspired tech product. The design process began with low-fidelity wireframes to establish the basic content hierarchy and navigation structure across three pages. These included consistent placement of navigation elements, clear call-to-actions, and thoughtful grouping of related content.</p>
<p>Mid-fidelity designs introduced a refined visual style and incorporated colour, imagery, and typography. Design principles explored include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Layout styles:</strong> such as feature-first, card-based, horizontal strips, and asymmetrical layouts.</li>
  <li><strong>Typography hierarchy:</strong> using bold headings, classic subheadings, and readable body text to guide user attention.</li>
  <li><strong>Colour palette:</strong> balancing strong contrasts with brand-inspired tones (black, grey, and yellow) to maintain accessibility and visual identity.</li>
  <li><strong>Design patterns:</strong> including repeated visual elements and structured alignment to enhance usability and flow.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project allowed me to practice building structured and user-centered web layouts while deepening my understanding of professional design tools and best practices in interface design.</p>
